# Cine_Torrent_Download

Developed by Pirate-Emperor, Cine_Torrent_Download is a Python-based application that provides users with the functionality to search and download torrents for movies.

## Features

- **Torrent Search**: Allows users to search for movie torrents based on keywords or titles.
- **Download Management**: Manages the download of torrents, providing options to pause, resume, or cancel.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Offers a command-line interface that is easy to use and navigate.
- **Download Progress**: Displays the download progress, including percentage completed and download speed.
- **Filtering Options**: Enables users to filter search results based on criteria such as seeders, leechers, and upload date.

## Components

- Torrents work using a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing protocol that allows users to share files across the internet. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how torrent downloading works:

- Torrent File: To start downloading a file using torrents, you first need a torrent file. A torrent file is a small file that contains metadata about the files you want to download and the network of computers that have these files. It doesn't contain the actual data to be shared.

- BitTorrent Client: To open the torrent file, you need a BitTorrent client, which is a software application designed to communicate using the BitTorrent protocol. Popular BitTorrent clients include uTorrent, BitTorrent, and qBittorrent.

- Trackers and DHT: The torrent file contains information about where to find people (peers) who have the file you want to download. This could be in the form of a tracker (a server that keeps track of which seeds and peers are in the swarm) or through Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for trackerless torrents.

- Downloading the File: When you open a torrent file in your BitTorrent client, the client connects to the tracker or DHT and locates peers who have the files you want. Your BitTorrent client then downloads pieces of the file from multiple sources in parallel. This is the essence of P2P file sharing.

- Seeding: Once you have downloaded a file, you automatically become a seeder, which means that others can download parts of the file from you. This helps to maintain the torrent swarm and ensure the availability of the file for others. Seeding is an important part of the torrent ecosystem because it ensures that files are available even if the original uploader is no longer sharing the file.

- File Integrity: The torrent file also contains a hash code for every piece of the file. This code is used to verify that each piece is intact and hasn't been corrupted during the download process. If a piece fails the integrity check, it is re-downloaded from a different source.

- Remember that while torrents can be used for legitimate purposes, they are also commonly used to distribute copyrighted material without permission. Downloading copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner is illegal in many jurisdictions. Always respect copyright laws and the rights of content creators.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., requests, BeautifulSoup, libtorrent)

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pirate-Emperor/Cine_Torrent_Download.git
cd Cine_Torrent_Download
```

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to search for torrents, select a torrent to download, and manage the download process.

## Data Source

The project uses web scraping techniques to search for torrents on popular torrent websites. You can update the list of torrent websites or add custom search functionality based on your preferences.

## Development

To enhance the project, you can modify the Python scripts in the `src` directory. Some potential areas for improvement include:

- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- Adding support for magnet links and integrating with other torrent clients.
- Implementing a recommendation system based on user download history.
- Expanding the application to include TV shows, music, and other media types.
